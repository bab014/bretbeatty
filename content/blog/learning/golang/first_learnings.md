### Starting with Python :snake:

About 3 years ago at work they told us we would need to start learning Python since most of the enterprise GUI tools would be going away.
I was pretty excited at the thought of learning how to program computers, I've always enjoyed learning and the prospect of unlocking the secrets of computers sounded like a lot of fun. Like learning any new language it started out slow and I am an inpatient person so going through the abc's of Python was some what excruciating for me But I slogged on, and what I found worked best, was forcing myself to use the language as my only option for my work. I built things every day, sosmetimes horribly but this is when I really started to take a liking to coding and und that I have a real knack for it. Python got me interested in learning more and growing that skill to see where it could take me.

### Discovering Go

I'm not sure how I discovered Go to be honest. I've always been fascinated by Google and there approach to solving problems. If you're interested, check out [this book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-audiobook/dp/B00MOZPSYW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+google+works&qid=1632317558&sr=8-1) :blue_book:. I had access to [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and it was from here that I saw a course for [learning Go](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/) and it looked really interesting to me so without hesitation I signed up. The course was awesome, and the guy who teaches it, [Todd McLeod](https://twitter.com/Todd_McLeod) does an excellent job of walking you through the basics.
